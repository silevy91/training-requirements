# Basic Data Science Web Development

Suggested pre-requisites: [Python Programming](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/Python%20Programming) and [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/Python%20for%20Data%20Science)

Create and deploy a `dash` application for exploring the gapminder dataset:

1. Get the Gapminder dataset (provided in this repo)
2. Create the basic `dash` application to display the dataset
3. Add callbacks that allow the user to:
- Switch from linear to log scale on the axes
- Change the data type displayed in the plot
- Change the year being shown
4. Improve the layout and UI so that it is easy and relatively intuitive to use
5. Deploy your app (using a free account) to `Heroku` and send Henry the link. 

Here is an example: https://dash-app-test-hm.herokuapp.com/
