# R for Data Science

Suggested pre-requisites: [R Programming](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/R%20Programming)

`R` is an excellent language for Data Science. Some might even argue that Data Science is what `R` is for! 

While `Python` is also an excellent language, it still lags far behind the convenience and extensibility of the `R` Data Science ecosystem. Even the `DataFrame` structure is built into base `R` without any extra package needed! Moreover, there is no better tool than `RStudio` for writing code that quickly and efficiently completes Data Science tasks. 

In this miniproject, your task is to analyze the `gapminder_clean.csv` dataset using `R` and the `tidyverse`. Wherever possible, your code should use `tidyverse` functions. For example:

Instead of this:
```
my_data <- my_data[which(my_data$col1 == 10 | my_data$col2 == "Yes"),]
my_data$new_col <- 10*my_data$col1
png("my_plot.png")
plot(my_data$col1, my_data$new_col)
title("some title")
dev.off()
```
Do this:
```
my_data %>%
    filter(col1 == 10 | col2 == "Yes") %>%
    mutate(new_col = 10*col1) %>%
    ggplot2(aes(x = col1, y = new_col)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title="some title") +
    ggsave("my_plot.png")
```

Complete the following analysis in `R` and generate an `RMarkdown` report to show the analysis and results:

1. Read in the `gapminder_clean.csv` data as a `tibble` using `read_csv`.
2. Filter the data to include only rows where `Year` is `1962` and then make a scatter plot comparing `'CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)'` and `gdpPercap` for the filtered data. 
3. On the filtered data, calculate the pearson correlation of `'CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)'` and `gdpPercap`. What is the Pearson R value and associated p value?
4. On the unfiltered data, answer "In what year is the correlation between `'CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)'` and `gdpPercap` the strongest?" Filter the dataset to that year for the next step...
5. Using `plotly`, create an interactive scatter plot comparing `'CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)'` and `gdpPercap`, where the point size is determined by `pop` (population) and the color is determined by the `continent`. You can easily convert any `ggplot` plot to a `plotly` plot using the `ggplotly()` command.

Now, without further guidance, use your `R` Data Science skills (and appropriate statistical tests) to answer the following:

1. What is the relationship between `continent` and `'Energy use (kg of oil equivalent per capita)'`? (stats test needed)
2. Is there a significant difference between Europe and Asia with respect to `'Imports of goods and services (% of GDP)'` in the years after 1990? (stats test needed)
3. What is the country (or countries) that has the highest `'Population density (people per sq. km of land area)'` across all years? (i.e., which country has the highest average ranking in this category across each time point in the dataset?)
4. What country (or countries) has shown the greatest increase in `'Life expectancy at birth, total (years)'` since 1962? 

For each question, you should generate summary visualizations (preferrably interactive ones) that demonstrate your answer to each question. Additionally, the analysis must be user-friendly for a non-programmer and should intuitively convey the insights you uncovered. Use `markdown` to ensure that the text is organized, readable, and stylish. For an example an a well-done RMarkdown report see [this example](https://static-html-pages.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/merck-project/RloopCorrelationSummary.html).  

Once you are done, export your `RMarkdown` to an `.html` file. All code and the resulting report should be commited using `git` and pushed to your fork of the training repo on GitHub. Once you are finished, let Henry know and he will check your `.html` file on GitHub. 

## Learning Resources

The techniques you apply here can be learned from DataCamp courses in the "Data Scientist with R" career track ([link](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-r)). It's recommended to take as many of these courses as needed. Everything up until "Supervised Learning in R: Classification" is pretty directly relevant.

You can also learn most of these skills from the free book, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
