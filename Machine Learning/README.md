# Supervised Machine Learning

Suggested pre-requisite: [`R for Data Science/`](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/R%20for%20Data%20Science) or [`Python for Data Science/`](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/Python%20for%20Data%20Science)


Supervised machine learning is a field of data science concerned with training predictive models for various tasks. An example would be a linear model that can predict a person's weight based on their height. In this miniproject, you will perform a supervised machine learning analysis and build a model that can predict whether passengers aboard the Titanic are likely to survive or not. Complete the following:

1. Sign up for Kaggle and start the Titanic challenge from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using typical methods (e.g., PCA, feature correlation, etc)
3. Create a binary classifier that can predict whether passengers will live or not.
4. Submit your final predictions to Kaggle.
5. Refine the model until you have > 75% accuracy. Then, share your notebook on Kaggle with Henry (username is "millerh1").

DataCamp (https://learn.datacamp.com/) has an excellent courses on supervised machine learning in both R and python.
